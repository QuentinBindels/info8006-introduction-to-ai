# Philosophy

## Thorough and detailed
- Understand the landscape of artificial intelligence.
- Be able to write from scratch, debug and run (some) AI algorithms.

## Well established algorithms and state-of-the-art
- Well-established algorithms for building intelligent agents.
- Introduction to materials new from research ($\leq$ 5 years old).
- Understand some of the open questions and challenges in the field.

## Practical
- Fun and challenging course project.

## Programming project

Implement an intelligent agent for playing **Pacman**. The project will be divided into three parts, with increasing levels of difficulty:
- Eat as much dots as possible
- Eat as much dots as possible, while not getting killed by ghosts (deterministic)
- Eat as much dots as possible, while not getting killed by ghosts (stochastic)
